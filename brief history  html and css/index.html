      <p>
        Lilian Ngoyi was born in Pretoria in 1911 to a Bapedi family of six
        children. She initially received teacher training at the Kilnerton
        Training Institution. When her father could no longer afford her fees,
        she began training as a nurse at the City Deep Mine Hospital.
        Eventually, she took employment in a garment factory between 1945 and
        1956, where she joined and became active in the Garment Workers Union
        under the leadership of Solly Sachs.
